Place your '.h5' data files in this directory from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jjcdL20CHWmAd9DsIdgP_B7IIEARKdSx

To run the program with your own data files instead, you can either provide the paths of the data files as arguments as explained in the usage section.
Alternatively, you can run the program with default arguments by adding your files in this data directory with the naming scheme:
- "bd_test.h5" - poisoned test data
- "bd_valid.h5" - poisoned validation data
- "data.txt" - instructions to download data
- "test.h5" - clean test data
- "valid.h5" - clean validation data
